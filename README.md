## 🧠 Overview 🧠

This chatbot is designed for basic conversational interactions. It is a perfect starting point for anyone looking to build a chatbot using Python. The chatbot can engage in text-based conversations and has a log file (chat_log.csv) that keeps track of previous interactions.

####  Key Features:

Basic Chat Functionality: Engage in simple conversations with the bot.

Text-based Input and Output: Easy interaction via command line.

Chat Log: Tracks and saves all conversations in `chat_log.csv`.

## 🌟 Features 🌟
Conversational AI: A simple chatbot that can converse with users in natural language.

Data Logging: All chats are saved in a CSV file for future reference and analysis.

Easy to Modify: Easily extendable with additional functionalities like NLP or API integrations.

## 🛠️ Installation 🛠️

#### Requirements

Python 3.8+ 

Basic Python libraries such as nltk or transformers (if you want to enhance the bot's capabilities).

####  Steps
1. Clone the Repository:


    First, clone the repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/RAK4307/Chatbot.git

        cd Chatbot

2. Install Dependencies:

   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the necessary dependencies:

        python -m venv venv

        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Application:

    After installing the dependencies, run the chatbot using the following command:

        streamlit run chatbot.py

    The chatbot will be available in the terminal for interaction.

## 🎯 Usage 
Once the chatbot is running, simply type your questions or statements, and the bot will respond accordingly.

#### Example Conversation:

`User`: Hello, how are you?

`Bot`: Hi there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How can I assist you today?
